# rubyrss
Ruby implementation of an RSS reader.

The rssData.rb file contain the data models we will be using to manage and store RSS Data from an online RSS Feed.

The rssManager.rb file is our custom Library/API to extract and parse data from online RSS Feeds.

The Main.rb file is the entry point of our RSS Reader Application. 
(An entry point is where the first instructions of a program are executed.)


To run the program,
Download all the files and store them in a file(f)
open terminal and (do cd copy the path of the file(f))
use command:
ruby main.rb
